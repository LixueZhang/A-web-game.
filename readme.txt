This color game shows you how to combine html, css, and javascript together to create some funny things.

By using javascript, one can change the web content dynamically.

If you want to use this as a small project tutorial, please read the html and css files first.

When you already understand all things in that part, you can start to consider the dynamic content in javascript.
